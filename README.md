# Cellular Automata Unity CSharp

application of conway game of life using unity 3D, while unity is relativly easy to use it's bad at handling workloads, 
but it's far more flexible you can change the shape of the cells by adding two line of code, easly switch between 2D cells
and 3D cells. but it's still slow the app craches at 1 000 000 cells, that mostly due to the old version C# used in unity.
